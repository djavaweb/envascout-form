# EnvaScout Form
> Integration between Envato API, Helpscout, and Caldera Forms.

## Motivation
Before this plugin was created, djavaweb are using old traditional customer support plugin. But we're decide to move using helpscout and envato oauth. Benefits using envato oauth is we can verify user's purchase. In traditional way we're using purchase code to verifying whether user have bought our item or not.

## Install

2. Upload zip, click on `Upload Plugin`.
3. After Installing, Activates `Envascout Form`.

## Features
